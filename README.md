# Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Support Vector Machines

Used the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) Diagnostic data set, which has been pre-processed and partitioned into training, validation and test sets.

**Model Learning**: Used scikit-learn's [SVC](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVC.html) function to learn SVM models with **radial-basis kernels** for each combination of *C* and *Î³* in {10<sup>-2</sup>, 10<sup>-1</sup>, 1, 10<sup>1</sup>, 10<sup>2</sup>}, and training them with the **Training set**.

**Loss computation**: Used scikit-learn's [metrics.hinge_loss](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.hinge_loss.html) function to find the *maximum-margin classification error*, and compute the training and validation error for each combination of tuning parameters (C and \Gamma).

**Final Model Selection**: Used the **Validation set** to select the best classifier corresponding to the best parameter values, $C_{best}$ and $\gamma_{best}$, for which the validation error is minimum.
Then fit the finalized model with the training data.

**Accuracy testing**: The accuracy *score* of the selected model is computed on the **Test set**.
